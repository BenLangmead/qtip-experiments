- Try a range of read lengths and sensitivity settings (fix simulator)
- Try a range of simulators (fix read length and sensitivity)
- Try a real-world dataset (e.g. flow-sorted)
  + Maybe just make a ROC, since we don't know enough to make a good
    predicted/actual plot
- Try a dataset where reads are of various lengths
