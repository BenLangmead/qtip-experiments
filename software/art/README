I have tried a few times to compile Art from source but have always
failed.  Luckily, binaries are available.

Art uses "profiles" to generate realistic quality strings and
sequencing errors.  The Illumina version of Art comes with a GAII
profile.  You can download a MiSeq profile here:

But it looks like it's already included!
